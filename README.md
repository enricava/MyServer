# MyServer
## Compile and run (simple copy pasters):
Server:

	g++ -o server.out server.cpp && ./server.out :: 2222
Client:

	g++ -o client.out client.cpp && ./client.out :: 2222

The goal of this project is very simple: to build a multiprocess server to enable file transfer to, from and between clients.
