# MyServer

The goal of this project is very simple: to build a multiprocess server to enable file transfer to, from and between clients.

## Compile and run OLD server/client (simple copy pasters):
Server:

	g++ -o server.out server.cpp && ./server.out :: 2222
Client:

	g++ -o client.out client.cpp && ./client.out :: 2222
